Hi,
I finally managed to compile the latest source on a recent gentoo system.

I had to install the packages
dev-cpp/eigen
dev-libs/boost
dev-qt/qt-creator

#include <Eigen/*> was not found after installing the dev-cpp/eigen
package. I had to rewrite this include line with the complete path as

-- #include <Eigen/Dense>
++ #include "/usr/include/eigen3/Eigen/Dense"

I will check, if my system needed some help to find the installed libs
correctly.

Additionally I saw several warnings about declarations during the build
one of these:

/tmp/clip4/build-Clip4-Desktop-Debug/qrc_resources.cpp:12873: warning:
no previous declaration for 'int qCleanupResources_resources()'
[-Wmissing-declarations]


Clip4 finally works and starts very fast. While I saw many crashes in
the windows version if one plays around with the histogram it works very
stable on gentoo linux.

Kind regards,
